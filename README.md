# Printf()
------
This is a collaboration project between Samuel Akwensivie and Bright Daniel as part of the ALX software engineering course.
The aim of this project is to recreate the famous printf() function.

The printf is a function that prints formatted output. It has the prototype as:

	int _printf(const char *format, ...);

Where **format** is a string that contains flags and specifiers on how the variadic arguments of the printf variadic function should be printed.
